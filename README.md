# Calculator Project  

This is my calculator project, like every programmer has to make one at some point.  

## The Challenge  
- Make it in **C++** with little to no outside prebuilt tools.  
- Implement my own numbers class (soon I realized I needed to implement a floating-point numbers class).  
- Create a nice *GUI* that works.  

I hope I have completed all my challenges successfully and invite you (the user) to mess things up—I mean, test my program.  

### Some context of what it can do:  
- The basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are currently supported.  
- We'll see if I decide to add more features later.
